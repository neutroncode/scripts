# Scripts
Bunch of scripts I made either for fun or for automation.

### Important scripts
`changeProxy.py`: Changes proxy in privoxy. I usually need this if I am searching for a **gasp!** free proxy that works, so that means I need to change the settings quickly and without fuss. This tool help me do just that.

`randomhostname.py`: Changes the hostname of the computer. Useful if you need privacy in a wifi hotspot, for example. May add MAC address randomization in the future.

`password-gen.py`: Generates a password. Simple, right?

### Not so important scripts
`code.py`: Want to look like a super 1337 h4x03r just like in the movies? Well now you can. This lil' script prints a bunch of code in the terminal, forever!

`DoS.py`: Phreak your friends out with this portable DoS script! Definitely not just a clone of `code.py` but with different text!

More will follow. Or maybe not. Meh, who knows.
